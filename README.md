[cryptogram solver for simple subsitution ciphers]

uses n-gram analysis (mainly letter bigrams) to evaluate certain key states through table swapping, and has optimization options of simulated annealing, stochastic hill climbing, 2-depth best neighbor hill climbing, and a few more. Right now 2-depth best neighbor generally works the best, though depending on the ciphertext, others could work better. 

currently the program works relatively well, but can be heavily improved. word n-grams and punishment for bad keys are ideas to be tested in the future.

-still in heavy development-
